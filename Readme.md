# Veterinary Patient Follow-up

this **veterinary follow-up** app is a project made to showcase the use of react and state management and also I build it to show it in my personal portfolio

## features & libraries

This is a full frontend app made with react so I was bound to use some of the tools crafted for specific purposes, I wanted this to be as simple as possible in terms of libraries added and what brings to the table. Here's the list:

**Vite**: I needed a nice and easy dev environment, hot reload and commodity.
**TailwindCSS**: I find it easier to style my components if I do it by myself.
